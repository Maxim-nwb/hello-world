Just my first test and start on git.
Its my first changes file and commit, awesome 0_0

Time capsule {I'm just starting to program, and it's like a time capsule, a message for me in the future. I do not know how things will turn out in the future, maybe I will become a good developer, maybe I will make monkey code, maybe I will give up all this altogether. But now I want to learn programming and try to develop in this direction, learn how to write good code and create useful applications. Expand my knowledge, find my first job, I hope that I will succeed. Oh, and I'm also hoping to improve my English skills, which is totally crap right now.}
